#TreeMaker

TreeMaker is a python program which creates useful phylogenies from very large
phylogenies.

You give it a list of species for which you want a phylogenetic hypothesis, and some 
very large phylogenetic tree and alignment of species in that clade.

It does a bunch of smart things to generate a phylogenetic hypothesis for the species
in your sample.
